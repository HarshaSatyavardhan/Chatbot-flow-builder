## Features

1. Drag and drop custom nodes.
2. Connect nodes by clicking and dragging from one node's edge to another to add functionality.
3. Clicking on a node selects it, and its label can be modified from the sidebar.
4. Clicking anywhere on the pane deselects the selected node.
5. Save and restore functionality, which saves the current state of the nodes and their connections, and can restore the state later.
